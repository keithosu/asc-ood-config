description: "This app will launch a FULL desktop on a compute node. This desktop is a scalable environment for when you need a lot of compute and/or memory resources because you will have full access to all the resources on that compute node(s). <p> If you do not need all these resources, use the Unity VDI app instead which is much more lightweight for general-purpose use cases."
